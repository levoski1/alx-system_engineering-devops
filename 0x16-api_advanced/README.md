# Reddit API Advanced Python Scripting

## Background Context
This project focuses on utilizing the Reddit API for advanced Python scripting. It's designed to help you practice making API calls, parsing JSON data, and handling pagination.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand how to read API documentation to find desired endpoints.
- Use APIs with pagination.
- Parse JSON results from an API.
- Make recursive API calls.
- Sort dictionaries by value.

## Requirements
- Use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with python3 (version 3.4.3).
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
- Ensure all files are executable and end with a new line.
- Organize libraries imported in Python files in alphabetical order.
- Include a README.md file at the root of the project directory.

## Tasks
1. **How many subs?**: Write a function that queries the Reddit API and returns the number of subscribers for a given subreddit.
2. **Top Ten**: Query the Reddit API and print the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit.
3. **Recurse it!**: Write a recursive function that returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit.
4. **Count it!**: Create a recursive function that parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords.
